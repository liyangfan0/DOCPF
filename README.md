# Object Tracking in Satellite Videos with Distractor-Occlusion Aware Correlation Particle Filters (IEEE TGRS'24)

## Abstract
DOCPF is designed for the object tracking in satellite videos which is robust to occlusion and distractors.

## Datesets
SatSOT consists of 105 satellite video sequences: 26 trains, 65 cars, 9 planes and 5 ships with 27,664 frames in total.

The average video length of SatSOT is 263 frames. The shortest video consists of 120 frames, while the longest one contains 750 frames.

SatSOT contains the significant challenges in satellite video object tracking, such as small targets, complex backgrounds, and severe occlusion.

## Running
The datesets path is set as './SatSOT'

Run test.m to acquire the tracking results of DOPCF

The tracking results which are saved in ./results/SatSOT

## Raw Results
We provide the raw tracking results of DOCPF and CPKF(TGRS'22)
